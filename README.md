Hello, I am Eldon, Cyber Security Professional

I'm a fastidious learner and want to get better at taking notes, so this Github serves as a way to take notes for myself and create my own stuff.

As I've learned I've realized that I should be better about making my work publicly accessible, so look out in the future for public repos following my learning and work in cybersecurity that does not violate Github's terms of service or would could be used to accuse me of plagerism!!!
